    Wrapper class which implements the iterator interface

    it works by tracking an index in the string internally.

    This allows the following additional features:

    * Checking whether the iterator has any elements left
      using empty()
    * Jumping back to a previous point via backtrack()

    The object exposes the following attributes:

    * pos: the index of the last element received via __next__()
    * wrapped: the string used for construction

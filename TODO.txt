* Support for **some** ANSI escape sequences
	* Also handle \r and \b properly
	* Bracketed paste
	* OSC sequences (see e. g. foot-ctlseqs(7))
		* Setting the window title
		* Setting the working directory of the terminal (useful if we
		  want to support opening an instance in the same directory)
		* URL markers
		* Desktop notifications
		* Clipboard interaction
* Use graphical IDE-like overlay for completions
	* GtkEntryCompletion?
* Improve completion support:
	* Expand '~' in completions to $HOME
	* Somehow provide completions for executables in $PATH
	* Only allow completions when cursor is at end?
* Add history backwards search using ctrl+r
* Improve ctrl+f search support
	* Add button to allow case-insensitive search
	* Optionally(?) highlight all matches
* Provide some heuristic support for disabling echo
	* Useful for entering passwords
	* Also ensures that passwords don't show up in history
	* 9term has a heuristic for this
* Fix use of ssh within saneterm
	* ssh forces echo (see previous entry)
* Make sure no input is lost in-between output points
	* For example, when text is typed before the prompt is redrawn
* When text is entered before output point, cursor_at_end doesn't work
* Configure vertical scrollbar (and other stuff that may come up) via Gtk properties?
	* Allows changing this setting via dconf-editor / gsettings
	* How would you configure it without dconf-editor / gsettings?
* autoscroll: Maybe only stop scrolling if text exceeds window size
